### Hello community! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior software engineer interested in topics like distributed systems, complex event processing, software architecture and design, infrastructure, operation, and more.
I love to analyze complex problems to conceive efficient and coherent solutions, but what I love the most is to use my skills to build awesome products that make people's lives better, and that's exactly what I do at RDStation.
